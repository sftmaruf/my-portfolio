                <p className='mt-4'>In my memories, I remember when I was a Tech addicted I was thinking about how the software is made for tech devices. And then after immense searching for the first time, I become familiar with the term 'Programming Language'.
                <br /><br/>
                This enthusiasm for technology brings me to the software engineering field. And now it became my passion and also my career for the rest of my life.
                <br /><br/>
                Still, there's certainly yet more to learn and I commit to myself for learning lifelong.
